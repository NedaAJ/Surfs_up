## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this study is to provide a basic statistical analysis of **Oahu's temperatures** for the months of **June** and **December**. This will aid in determining whether the surf and ice cream shop business is year-round viable. We can collect information such as *average, maximum, and lowest temperatures* by crafting a query that captures temperatures particularly for the months of June and December.

## Results
### June Tempreture Analysis
We can observe that there are **1,700 observations** for the months of June based on the study. This covers the period from *2010 to 2017*. Below are the **average, minimum, and maximum temperatures**. Because of the *low standard deviation*, the temperature readings have a narrow spread. This makes sense because the weather on Oahu does not seem to change much.

### December Tempreture Analysis
In contrast, December appears to contain only **1,517 observations**. This means that some of the dates don't have any temperature data and are null. However, because we have such a big sample size, our study will be quite representative. We can observe from the graphs that the *average, maximum, and minimum temperatures* in June and December are very similar. More crucially, the spread is almost the same as the spread for June.

## Summary
We may determine that temperature patterns remain consistent throughout the year by comparing the statistic summary of the two months. However, we need to incorporate two more inquiries to acquire a better knowledge of the weather on Oahu. While *temperatures* may remain relatively constant throughout the year, **precipitation** may not, and this would have a substantial impact on the business's **long-term viability**. We can get a better sense of the general weather pattern by doing a statistical review of the precipitation patterns between June and December.

Comparing the most active stations to weather patterns is another query that may be constructed to aid our investigation. By combining the **most popular station** with the most **steady weather patterns**, we can narrow down the **optimal site**.
